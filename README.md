Jig-Saw Puzzle

The JIGSAW Solver given has 16 pieces arranged
in a random order and we need to bring all
the pieces at their original position and the main challenge is
that we should not take the reference of the original image as
through which one can compare the both of them and can obtain
the results, as our goal is to create an agent which solves the
problem by thinking about it. Here we are going to use the concept of energy.(Stimulated Annealing)
